# Java Asynchronous Elevator Simulation

## Overview

This project is a simulation of an elevator system, implemented in Java to demonstrate the use of asynchronous events. Developed collaboratively with one other team member, this simulation aims to replicate the functioning of a real-world elevator, handling multiple floor requests and managing elevator movements efficiently.

## Features

- Simulates the operation of an elevator in a building.
- Handles asynchronous floor requests from users.
- Efficiently manages elevator movements to serve requests in a timely manner.
- Demonstrates the use of Java's concurrency and event-handling mechanisms.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java

## Installation and Usage

To run the elevator simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Alexis-Marcel/Elevator-Simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd Elevator-Simulation
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```
   javac Main.java
   ```
4. Run the simulation:
   ```
   java Main
   ```
